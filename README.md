# Getting Started with AutoList

-This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

-Redux is used for state management and persistance of API data

-Redux thunk is being used as middleware

-Material UI is used for atomic components and for quick setup of application layout

-Hooks are used for state interactions and interjecting react lifecycle

-Application root route refers to `Home` component

-Please note the header menu items are dummy

-Please note that font sizes are as per meterial-ui typography, I tried overriding them but font size ->14px seemed too small for readability
