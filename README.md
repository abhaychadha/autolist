# Getting Started with AutoList

-This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
-Redux is used for state management and persistance of API data
-Redux thunk is being used as middleware
-Material UI is used for atomic components and for quick setup of application layout
-Hooks are used for state interactions and interjecting react lifecycle
-Application root route refers to `Home` component
-Please note the header menu items are dummy
-Please note that font sizes are as per meterial-ui typography, I tried overriding them but font size ->14px seemed too small for readability
